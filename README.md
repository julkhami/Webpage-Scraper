# Webpage-Scraper
Drop in a url to the home page of a website. This effectively crawls all relevant pages of that website. It launches a GUI window to help you easily cherry-pick which sites you want to discard and which to keep. It also has a second round with helpful tools for trying to teach the script which text content to keep and which to exclude. Finally, it crawls, and scrapes/text extracts the entire website in accordance with the rules you put in place, and returns it as plaintext. Lastly, it performs a keyword extraction on that data - but that's possible with the separate tool, Term Extractor. However, I might also make the term extraction happen on the fly, while it is crawling - another possible variant.
